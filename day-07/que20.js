/*  Question 20:
Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains,
 rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/
// Initializing an array of country names that I would like to visit
var countries = ["Italy", "Australia", "Norway", "Brazil", "South Africa"];
// Logging the list of countries to the console
console.log("Countries I'd like to visit:", countries);
